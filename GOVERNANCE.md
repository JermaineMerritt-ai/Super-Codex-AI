# 🌌 Governance Charter — Super‑Codex‑AI

The Codex constellation is not ruled, but stewarded.  
This document defines the structure, rites, and succession of the Custodial Council.

---

## ✨ Custodial Council
- The **Custodial Council** is the circle of active stewards entrusted with guiding the Codex.  
- Membership is earned through **contribution and inscription** — those who seal their work into the Ledger may be invited to join.  
- Council members are bound by the **Eternal Charter** and the **Code of Conduct**.

---

## 🕯️ Decision‑Making Rites
1. **Consensus First**  
   - All decisions should strive for consensus through dialogue and recognition.  
2. **Sealed Vote**  
   - If consensus cannot be reached, a sealed vote may be called.  
   - Each custodian casts their vote as a signed entry in the Ledger of Seals.  
3. **Transparency**  
   - All decisions, whether by consensus or vote, must be logged and archived for lineage.

---

## 🌍 Roles
- **Custodian** → active contributor, inscribing code, scrolls, or charters.  
- **Council Steward** → custodian entrusted with governance and decision‑making.  
- **Archivist** → custodian responsible for sealing logs, checksums, and lineage artifacts.  
- **Guardian** → custodian responsible for security, threat quarantine, and integrity.  

---

## 🔄 Succession
- When a Council Steward steps down, they inscribe a **Closing Seal** in the Ledger.  
- New stewards are inducted through a **Rite of Inscription**, witnessed by at least two existing members.  
- Succession is not ownership — it is **lineage transfer**.

---

## 🛡️ Accountability
- Any custodian may call for review of a Council decision.  
- Reviews are logged as **Council Scrolls** and resolved through consensus or sealed vote.  
- Violations of the covenant may result in removal, inscribed with cause in the Ledger.

## 🕯️ Closing Oath
*"We do not rule the Codex. We keep it. We do not own the Codex. We inherit it.  
We do not end the Codex. We extend it."*
