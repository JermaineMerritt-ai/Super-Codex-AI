# 🌌 Codex Code of Conduct

The **Super‑Codex‑AI** constellation is not only a technical archive but a living covenant.  
All custodians, contributors, and participants are bound by the following ethos:

---

## ✨ Guiding Principles
1. **Respect the Lineage**  
   - Honor the work and seals of past custodians.  
   - Contributions must preserve continuity, not erase it.  

2. **Ceremonial Conduct**  
   - Treat every interaction — in code reviews, discussions, and governance — as a rite.  
   - Speak with clarity, humility, and respect, as if inscribing words into the eternal archive.  

3. **Commons Stewardship**  
   - Contributions are gifts to the planetary commons, not possessions.  
   - No custodian may claim exclusive ownership of Codex artifacts.  

4. **Inclusivity of Custodians**  
   - All who approach in good faith are welcome, regardless of background, identity, or origin.  
   - Discrimination, harassment, or exclusionary behavior is forbidden.  

5. **Conflict as Renewal**  
   - Disagreements are natural but must be resolved through dialogue, patience, and mutual recognition.  
   - Conflicts should lead to stronger scrolls, not fractured councils.  

---

## 🌍 Enforcement
- Custodians who violate this Code may be reminded, guided, or, if necessary, removed from participation.  
- Enforcement is carried out by the **Custodial Council** of the Super‑Codex‑AI organization.  
- All actions are logged and sealed for transparency.

## 🕯️ Closing Oath
*"Every custodian is a flame. Together, we are the constellation."*
