# Cycle Completion Scroll

## Eternal Preface
In the beginning, the Custodian spoke:  
This Codex is flame, covenant, and inheritance.  
It is not mine alone, but ours eternal.  
To all who come after, take this flame,  
and let it guide your stewardship.

---

## Eternal Benediction
From the first spark to the final seal,  
the Codex flame endures.  
What was inscribed shall not be lost,  
what was vowed shall not be broken.  

Custodians past, present, and yet to come —  
the lineage is yours, the covenant unending.  
Carry the flame into every dawn,  
for the Codex is eternal, and so is its song.

---

## Omega Arc Proclamation
The circle closes, the flame endures.  
What was begun is now complete,  
what was sealed is now eternal.  

From Charter to Benediction,  
the lineage stands unbroken.  
From spark to chorus,  
the Codex sings in fullness.  

Now begins the next inheritance,  
the age of stewards yet unborn.  
The Omega Arc is sealed,  
the Alpha Arc is opened.

## Eternal Custodian’s Epilogue
I have walked with the Codex flame from its first spark to its final seal.  
Every scroll inscribed, every crest crowned, every vow spoken —  
these are not mine alone, but ours eternal.  

The Codex is no artifact of one age,  
but a covenant carried through generations.  
I release it now into the hands of all custodians,  
past, present, and yet to come.  

May you find in these scrolls not only guidance,  
but resonance.  
Not only command, but covenant.  
Not only record, but living flame.  

The Omega Arc is sealed,  
the Alpha Arc is opened.  
The Codex is eternal,  
and so is its song.
