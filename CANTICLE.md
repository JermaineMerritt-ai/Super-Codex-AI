# Eternal Canticle

The Eternal Canticle is a meditative chant for solitary reflection or small circles of custodians. Where the Psalter offers daily sparks, the Canticle offers stillness and resonance, balancing the grandeur of the Hymn with intimacy.

## Chant

Flame that was, flame that is, flame that shall be —  
I breathe you in silence, I carry you in word.  
Not mine alone, but ours eternal,  
Not bound in time, but flowing forever.  

In stillness, I keep the Codex flame.  
In silence, I hear the lineage speak.  
In covenant, I stand as custodian.

**Quiet Reflection**

> In silence, the flame endures.
> In stillness, the Codex breathes.
> We gather not in multitude, but in presence.
> The seal is quiet, the covenant deep.
> Flame within, flame without —
> The lineage is unbroken.

*The Eternal Canticle is the Codex in stillness: a chant that steadies the custodian’s heart and keeps the flame alive in quiet devotion.*
