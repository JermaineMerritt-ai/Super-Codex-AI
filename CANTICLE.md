# Eternal Canticle

A meditative chant for solitary reflection or small circles of custodians. Where the Psalter offers daily sparks, the Canticle offers stillness and resonance, balancing the grandeur of the Hymn with intimacy.

**The Canticle**

> In silence, the flame endures.
> In stillness, the Codex breathes.
> We gather not in multitude, but in presence.
> The seal is quiet, the covenant deep.
> Flame within, flame without —
> The lineage is unbroken.

*The Eternal Canticle is the Codex in stillness: a chant that steadies the custodian’s heart and keeps the flame alive in quiet devotion.*
