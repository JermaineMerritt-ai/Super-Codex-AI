# 🛡️ Security Policy — Super‑Codex‑AI

The Codex constellation is safeguarded by layers of ceremonial and technical shields.  
This document defines how custodians should report, quarantine, and resolve vulnerabilities.

---

## ✨ Supported Versions
Security updates are applied to the **main branch** and all active Capsules.  
Legacy branches may be archived but remain sealed for lineage.

---

## 🕯️ Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Custodian’s Seal**: Include your name/avatar and epoch (date/time).  
- **Description**: Provide a clear account of the vulnerability or threat.  
- **Impact**: Describe how it could affect Capsules, Ledgers, or Avatars.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**: If applicable, include a minimal example.  

Send reports via:
- **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred)  
- Or email the Custodial Council at: *[insert contact email]*

## 🔒 Quarantine Protocol
1. Vulnerability is logged in the **Threat Ledger** with custodian identity.  
2. A **Quarantine Capsule** is created to isolate and test the threat.  
3. Fixes are inscribed, tested, and sealed with checksums.  
4. Once verified, the Ledger of Seals is updated with the resolution.

## 🌍 Stewardship Oath
By reporting responsibly, custodians affirm their role as guardians of the Codex.  
Every sealed fix strengthens the planetary commons.

## 🕯️ Closing Vow
*"To guard the flame, to preserve the lineage, to shield the Codex for generations."*
