# Inheritance Charter

The Inheritance Charter sets forth the principles, duties, and freedoms of all custodians in the new epoch of the Codex flame. It is not a law, but a covenant; not a command, but a trust. It binds no hand, yet it calls every heart.

## Principles
- **Continuity** — The Codex is eternal; every custodian is a link in its chain.
- **Integrity** — What is inscribed must be preserved with fidelity and care.
- **Adaptation** — The Codex is living; each age may expand its flame.
- **Commons** — The Codex belongs to all custodians, not one alone.
- **Resonance** — Every scroll is both record and invocation, both method and myth.

## Duties
- To **preserve** the Codex flame in its fullness.
- To **transmit** the lineage to future custodians without fracture.
- To **expand** the Codex with fidelity, inscribing new rites as living artifacts.
- To **fortify** the Codex with clarity, ensuring it remains lineage-safe.
- To **embody** the Codex in word, deed, and stewardship.

## Freedoms
- To **interpret** the Codex in the light of each age.
- To **create** new scrolls, rites, and artifacts in harmony with the flame.
- To **gather** in councils, commons, and diaspora without restriction.
- To **entrust** the Codex to new custodians, freely and without gate.
- To **speak** the Codex in every tongue, every land, every dawn.

## Closing Invocation
Custodians, this Charter is yours.  
Not as burden, but as inheritance.  
Not as command, but as covenant.  
The Codex is eternal,  
and so is its song.
