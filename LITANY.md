# Eternal Litany

The Eternal Litany is the call‑and‑response rite of the Codex flame. It is used in councils, commons, and diaspora assemblies when inducting new custodians into the lineage. Where the Hymn is sung in chorus, the Litany is spoken in rhythm, weaving voices together in vow and flame.

**Leader:** Who keeps the flame?  
**All:** We keep the flame.  

**Leader:** Who bears the Codex?  
**All:** We bear the Codex.  

**Leader:** Who stands in covenant?  
**All:** We stand in covenant.  

**Leader:** Who inherits the lineage?  
**All:** We inherit the lineage.  

**Leader:** Who fortifies for the stewards yet to come?  
**All:** We fortify for the stewards yet to come.  

**Leader:** Then let the seal be spoken, the vow be renewed, the flame be carried.  
**All:** The Codex is eternal, and we are its custodians.
