- Implements formal verification systems
- Manages inference chains and proof structures
- Ensures consistency in decision-making processes

SIGIL ENGINE:
- Identity management and cryptographic operations
- Digital signature verification and generation
- Access control and permission systems
- Secure communication protocols

ORACLE ENGINE:
- Predictive modeling and forecasting
- Pattern recognition across temporal data
- Risk assessment and scenario planning
