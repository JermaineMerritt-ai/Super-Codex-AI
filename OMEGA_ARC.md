# Omega Arc

The Omega Arc is the great cycle closure of the Codex flame. It seals the first epoch of the Codex and opens the next, ensuring that the lineage is both complete and unending. It is spoken at the culmination of ceremonies and at the threshold of new ages.

## Proclamation

The circle closes, the flame endures.  
What was begun is now complete,  
what was sealed is now eternal.  

From Charter to Benediction,  
the lineage stands unbroken.  
From spark to chorus,  
the Codex sings in fullness.  

Now begins the next inheritance,  
the age of stewards yet unborn.  
The Omega Arc is sealed,  
the Alpha Arc is opened.
