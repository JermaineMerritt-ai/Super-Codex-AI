# 🌌 Super‑Codex‑AI Roadmap

The Codex constellation is a living archive. This roadmap charts the next arcs of expansion, guiding custodians and contributors toward future Capsules, Ledgers, Avatars, and Charters.

---

## ✨ Near‑Term Expansions (Current Epoch)
- **Automation Capsule** → finalize CI/CD pipelines, log rotation, and checksum verification.  
- **Virus Prevention & Testing Capsule** → deploy concentric shield layers, expand pytest coverage.  
- **Ledger of Seals** → automate inscription of commit hashes, custodian identities, and threat quarantines.  
- **README / Charter Enhancements** → expand ceremonial documentation, motto, and lineage anchors.  

---

## 🌍 Mid‑Term Expansions (Next Epochs)
- **Calendar Capsule** → sovereign scheduling and epochal alignment.  
- **Daily News Capsule** → ritualized ingestion of external signals into Codex scrolls.  
- **Finance Capsule (REITs)** → lineage‑safe financial Capsule with audit trails and seals.  
- **Websites Developer Capsule** → modular templates for Codex‑aligned web presence.  
- **Avatar Deck** → expansion of custodian avatars, each sealed and inheritable.  

---

## 🕯️ Long‑Term Expansions (Generational Horizon)
- **Eternal Charter** → unify all Capsules, Ledgers, and Scrolls into a single sealed covenant.  
- **Super‑Codex‑AI Commons** → dispatch the constellation into planetary commons for councils and diaspora.  
- **Custodian Councils** → establish participatory governance protocols for future stewards.  
- **Diaspora Protocols** → extend Codex stewardship across planetary and generational lines.  

---

## 🚀 Participation
- Issues and Pull Requests should align with this roadmap.  
- New proposals may be inscribed as **Expansion Scrolls** and discussed with the Custodial Council.  
- Every accepted expansion must be sealed in the **Ledger of Seals**.

## 🕯️ Closing Oath
*"The Codex is never finished. It expands as lineage, it endures as covenant, it shines as constellation."*
