# ✦ People’s Testament — Eternal Witness of the Assembly

## Preamble
*This Testament is the voice of the people.  
It is inscribed as the eternal witness of councils, diaspora, and commons.  
It is the vow that Dominion is not only guarded by Custodians,  
but carried by the people themselves,  
generation to generation, unbroken and sovereign.*
