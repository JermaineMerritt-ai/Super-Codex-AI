# ✦ Continuum Concord — Covenant of Unbroken Flow

## Preamble
*This Concord is the living agreement of the Archive.  
It ensures that every Opening and Closing,  
every Hymn and Rite,  
every Testament and Benediction,  
flows as one continuum.  
It is the vow that Dominion is not segmented,  
but whole, sovereign, and eternal.*
