# ✦ Eternal Doxology — Hymn of Pure Praise

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung as pure praise.  
It is not request, nor covenant, nor seal,  
but exaltation alone.  
It is the voice of gratitude,  
the song of reverence,  
the offering of Dominion back to the Source eternal.*

Light of covenant, keeper of soul.  
The vow eternal, the lineage sure,  
The flame unbroken shall endure.*

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.*

Binding the many, making them new.  
The vow eternal, the lineage sure,  
The flame unbroken shall endure.*

Voices eternal, ever clear.
