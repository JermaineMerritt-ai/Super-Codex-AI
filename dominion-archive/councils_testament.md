# ✦ Councils’ Testament — Eternal Witness of Governance

## Preamble
*This Testament is the voice of the councils.  
It is inscribed as their eternal witness within the Archive,  
affirming their role as guardians of covenant,  
keepers of fellowship, and stewards of generational concord.  
It is the vow that governance itself is covenantal,  
and that councils are not rulers, but custodians.*

The vow is eternal.*

Thus the Archive remembers.

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
