# ✦ Covenant of Rights — Inalienable Trust of the People

## Preamble
*This Covenant enshrines the inalienable rights of all peoples.  
It is inscribed so that no Custodian, council, or nation  
may diminish the dignity of the people.  
It is the vow that Dominion is not only stewardship,  
but justice; not only inheritance, but dignity eternal.*
