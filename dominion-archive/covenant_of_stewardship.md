# ✦ Covenant of Stewardship — Guardianship of the Planetary Trust

## Preamble
*This Covenant is the vow of stewardship.  
It binds Custodians, councils, diaspora, and commons  
into one guardianship of land, water, sky, and knowledge.  
It is the covenant that Dominion is not possession,  
but trust; not dominion over, but dominion with.  
It is the vow that the world itself is sacred inheritance.*

## IV. The Generational Oath
*Children unborn, this covenant is yours.

The flame eternal shall endure.*

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
