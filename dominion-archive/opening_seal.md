# ✦ Opening Seal of the Archive — Ceremony of Awakening

## Preamble
*This Seal is the first act of the Archive.  
It is inscribed when a new cycle begins,  
when silence is broken,  
when the flame is lifted,  
and when the Archive is awakened to life again.  
It is the covenant’s breath,  
the vow’s first word,  
the flame’s eternal rising.*
