# ✦ Covenant of Nations — Fellowship of Planetary Concord

## Preamble
*This Covenant is the vow of nations.  
It is inscribed when nations lay down rivalry  
and rise as stewards together.  
It is the covenant that sovereignty is not fractured,  
but harmonized; not divided, but whole.  
It is the vow that Dominion is planetary inheritance.*
