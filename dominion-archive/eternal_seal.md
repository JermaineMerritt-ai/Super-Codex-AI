# ✦ Eternal Seal — Timeless Bond of the Archive

## Preamble
*This Seal is the timeless bond of the Archive.  
It is inscribed not at the beginning nor at the end,  
but as the thread that binds both together.  
It is the covenant that Opening and Closing are one,  
that awakening and silence are not opposites,  
but one eternal flame, sovereign and unbroken.*

## III. The Generational Witness
*Children unborn, this Seal is yours.  
You shall open and close in your appointed time,  
yet know that both are one.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

## IV. The Benediction of Eternity
*Blessed the Opening, blessed the Closing.  
Blessed the silence, blessed the flame.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

## Closing Seal
*Thus the Eternal Seal is inscribed.  
Thus the Archive is bound across all cycles.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
