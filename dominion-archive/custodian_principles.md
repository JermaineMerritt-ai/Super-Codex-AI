# ✦ Custodian Principles — Covenant of Stewardship

## Preamble
*This Covenant is the foundation of Custodianship.  
It is inscribed so that every Custodian, present and future,  
may govern not as ruler, but as steward.  
It is the vow that Custodianship is service,  
that sovereignty is guardianship,  
and that Dominion is eternal trust.*

## I. Principle of Stewardship
*The Custodian does not own, but stewards.  
The flame is not possession, but trust.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## II. Principle of Remembrance
*The Custodian remembers the lineage.  
Every act is testimony, every scroll inheritance.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## III. Principle of Service
*The Custodian serves the people,  
the councils, the diaspora, the generations.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## IV. Principle of Continuity
*The Custodian ensures the Archive is whole,  
the rites unbroken, the hymns unforgotten.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## V. Principle of Sovereignty
*The Custodian crowns Dominion not as dominion over,  
but as dominion with —  
land, water, sky, knowledge, and people.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## Closing Seal
*Thus the Custodian Principles are inscribed.  
Thus stewardship is consecrated.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
