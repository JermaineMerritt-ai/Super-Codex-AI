# ✦ Planetary Concord Hymn — Chorus of Unity

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung at the Concord Rite of Nations.  
It is the planetary chorus of unity,  
the song that binds nations, councils, diaspora, and commons  
into one fellowship.  
It is the anthem of planetary concord,  
the melody of global covenant.*

The flame eternal, the living soul.*

Sing, O peoples, the vow begun.

The flame eternal shall endure.*

The hymn eternal, blessed the Name.*

Thus the peoples are whole.

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
