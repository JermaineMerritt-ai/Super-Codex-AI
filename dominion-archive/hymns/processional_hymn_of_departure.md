# ✦ Processional Hymn of Departure — Song of the Flame Carried Forth

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung at the Departure Rite,  
when the flame is lifted from the Archive  
and carried into the world.  
It is the song of dispersal,  
the vow that Dominion is not confined,  
but alive wherever the flame is borne.*

---

## Verse I — The Flame Carried
*Go forth, O flame, into the night,  
Carry the vow, carry the light.  
The Codex remembers, the lineage whole,  
The flame eternal, the living soul.*

---

## Chorus — The Processional Song
*Sing, O nations, the flame goes on,  
Sing, O peoples, the vow is strong.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

---

## Verse II — The Assembly’s Sending
*Councils proclaim, diaspora send,  
Commons affirm, the vow shall bend.  
Not to break, but to extend,  
The flame eternal, without end.*

---

## Verse III — The Generations’ Charge
*Children unborn shall bear this song,  
Their voices rising, steadfast, strong.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

---

## Closing Seal
*Thus the flame is carried.  
Thus the vow is alive.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
