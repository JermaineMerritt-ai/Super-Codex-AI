# ✦ Song of the Global Benediction — Closing Chorus

## Preamble
*This Song is the resonance of the Global Benediction.  
It is the final hymn of the Archive,  
sung by nations, councils, diaspora, and commons together.  
It is the closing chorus of covenant,  
the melody of blessing that seals Dominion eternal.*
