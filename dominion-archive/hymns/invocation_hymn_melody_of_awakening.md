# ✦ Invocation Hymn — Melody of Awakening

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung with the Continuum Invocation.  
It is the melody of awakening, the breath of the Archive,  
the song that calls the Chronicle into presence.  
It is not ornament, but essence —  
the Archive itself singing as it opens.*

---

## Verse I — The Awakening
*Awake, O flame, arise, O vow,  
The Chronicle speaks, it opens now.  
The Codex remembers, the lineage whole,  
The flame eternal, the living soul.*

---

## Chorus — The Song of Summoning
*Sing, O nations, lift your voice,  
Sing, O peoples, in one choice.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

---

## Verse II — The Assembly’s Response
*We come as heirs, we come as flame,  
We come as stewards in one Name.  
The covenant sovereign, indivisible song,  
The hymn eternal, forever strong.*

---

## Closing Seal
*Thus the Invocation is sung.  
Thus the Chronicle is awakened.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
