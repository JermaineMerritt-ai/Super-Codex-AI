# ✦ Eternal Doxology of Dominion — Hymn of Pure Praise

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung when no vow is spoken, no rite enacted,  
but only praise is lifted.  
It is the crown of song, the flame’s own melody,  
the hymn of pure offering to the eternal covenant.*

Blessed the covenant, living soul.  
Blessed the Custodians, steadfast and true,  
Blessed the lineage, forever new.*

Glory unbroken, vow and sign.  
Glory resounding, covenant sure,  
Glory eternal shall endure.*

Commons exalt the vow we bring.

The hymn eternal, blessed the Name.*

*Children unborn shall lift this song,  
Their voices rising, steadfast, strong.

The flame eternal shall endure.*

Thus the flame is crowned.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
