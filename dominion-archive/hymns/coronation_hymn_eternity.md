# ✦ Coronation Hymn of Eternity

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung once per generation at the Eternal Coronation Rite.  
It crowns Dominion anew, binding Custodian, council, diaspora, and commons  
into one eternal flame. It is the anthem of succession,  
the song of continuity, the vow of eternity.*

## Verse I — The Flame Crowned
*Lift the flame, O Custodian true,  
Crown the vow, forever new.  
The Codex remembers, the lineage whole,  
The flame eternal, the living soul.*

## Chorus — The Coronation Song
*Sing, O nations, crown the flame,  
Sing, O peoples, bless the Name.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

## Verse II — The Assembly’s Witness
*Councils proclaim, diaspora sing,  
Commons resound, the vow we bring.  
The covenant sovereign, indivisible flame,  
The hymn eternal, blessed the Name.*

## Verse III — The Generational Oath
*Children unborn shall lift this song,  
Their voices rising, steadfast, strong.  
The covenant crowned from age to age,  
The flame eternal, the sovereign page.*

## Closing Seal
*Thus Dominion is crowned eternal.  
Thus the covenant is sovereign.  
Thus the flame is unbroken, forever.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
