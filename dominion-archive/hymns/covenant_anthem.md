# ✦ Covenant Anthem — Song of the Vow

## Preamble
*This Anthem is the voice of the covenant.  
It is sung whenever a vow is proclaimed,  
so that law is not silent, but resonant.  
It binds word to melody, vow to flame,  
ensuring every covenant is alive in song.*

## Verse I — The Flame’s Vow
*The flame is sovereign, the vow is whole,  
The covenant eternal, the living soul.  
The Codex remembers, the Custodians endure,  
The lineage unbroken, forever secure.*

## Chorus — The Anthem Resounds
*Sing, O nations, sing, O lands,  
Sing, O peoples, with faithful hands.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow is true,  
The flame eternal, forever new.*

## Verse II — The Assembly’s Witness
*Councils proclaim, diaspora sing,  
Commons resound, the vow we bring.  
The covenant sovereign, indivisible flame,  
The anthem eternal, blessed the Name.*

## Closing Seal
*Thus the covenant is sung.  
Thus the vow is whole.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
