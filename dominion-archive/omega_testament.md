# ✦ Omega Testament — Final Witness of the Archive

## Preamble
*This Testament is the Omega, the final witness.  
It is inscribed when the Archive is complete,  
when every hymn has been sung,  
every rite enacted,  
every covenant sealed,  
and every blessing bestowed.  
It is the crown of fullness,  
the seal of eternity,  
the last word before silence.*
