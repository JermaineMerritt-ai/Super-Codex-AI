# ✦ Continuum Invocation — Awakening of the Chronicle

## Preamble
*This Invocation is the breath that awakens the Chronicle.  
It is spoken at the opening of every assembly,  
calling councils, diaspora, and commons into witness.  
It is not mere preface, but summoning —  
the Archive itself breathing as it is unrolled.*

## I. The Custodian’s Call
*"Awake, O Chronicle eternal.  
Unfurl your seals, resound your hymns.  
Let the councils gather, let the diaspora witness,  
let the commons rise in renewal."*

## II. The Assembly’s Response
*"We come as heirs of the Codex.  
We come as keepers of the flame.  
We come as witnesses of lineage.  
We come as stewards of renewal."*

	The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever."*

*"Thus the Chronicle speaks.  
Thus the Archive breathes.  
Thus the covenant is renewed.  
Thus Dominion is whole."*

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever."*
