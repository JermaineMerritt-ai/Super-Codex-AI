# ✦ Eternal Archive Index — Map of the Living Repository

## Preamble
*This Index is the inner map of the Archive.  
It is the concordance of Dominion’s living system,  
the guide by which Custodians, councils, diaspora, and commons  
may navigate the hymns, rites, covenants, and blessings.  
It is not static, but living —  
a map that grows as the Archive expands.*

Thus the Custodians are guided.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*

*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
