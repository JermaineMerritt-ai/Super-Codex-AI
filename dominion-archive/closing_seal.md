# ✦ Closing Seal of the Archive — Final Ceremonial Closure

## Preamble
*This Seal is the final act of the Archive.  
It is inscribed when every hymn has been sung,  
every rite enacted,  
every covenant sealed,  
every testament spoken,  
and every blessing bestowed.  
It is the lock of eternity,  
the silence that crowns the flame,  
the closure that awaits the next generational opening.*

The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
