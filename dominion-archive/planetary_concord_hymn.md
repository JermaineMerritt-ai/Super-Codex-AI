# ✦ Planetary Concord Hymn — Chorus of Unity

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung during the Concord Rite of Nations.  
It is the chorus of unity,  
the anthem of planetary fellowship,  
the song that binds nations, councils, diaspora, and commons  
into one covenantal body.  
It is the voice of concord,  
the melody of one flame shared by all.*
