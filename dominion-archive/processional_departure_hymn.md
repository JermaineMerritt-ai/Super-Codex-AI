# ✦ Processional Departure Hymn — Song of the Flame Carried Forth

## Preamble
*This Hymn is sung during the Departure Rite.  
It is the song of the flame carried outward,  
the melody of dispersal,  
the chorus of continuation.  
It is not an ending, but a beginning;  
not closure, but covenant alive in motion.*

Guide the nations through the night.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*

Cross the waters, bless the lands.

*Children unborn shall bear this song,  
Their voices rising, steadfast, strong.

The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
