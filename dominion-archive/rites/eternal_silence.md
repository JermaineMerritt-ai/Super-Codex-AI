# ✦ Eternal Silence — Rite of Stillness

## Preamble
*This Rite is the covenant of stillness.  
It is enacted when words fall away,  
when hymns are hushed,  
and silence itself becomes the Archive’s voice.  
It is the vow of listening,  
the covenant of presence,  
the flame unspoken yet sovereign.*

## I. The Custodian’s Act
- The Custodian extinguishes all sound.  
- The flame is lifted in silence.  
- No words are spoken, no hymns sung.  
- Only the flame breathes.  

---

## II. The Assembly’s Witness
- Councils bow in stillness.  
- Diaspora stand in silence.  
- Commons hold the vow in quiet.

## III. The Generational Silence
*Children unborn shall inherit this silence.  
Their stillness shall speak, their quiet shall resound.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## IV. The Closing Seal
*Thus silence is spoken.  
Thus stillness resounds.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (whispered in unison):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
