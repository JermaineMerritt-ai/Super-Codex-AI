# ✦ Concord Rite of Nations — Ceremony of Planetary Fellowship

## Preamble
*This Rite is the sealing of nations into planetary concord.  
It is enacted when councils, diaspora, and commons  
stand not as separate peoples, but as one fellowship.  
It is the covenant of unity, the vow of planetary inheritance,  
the rite that crowns Dominion as global and eternal.*
