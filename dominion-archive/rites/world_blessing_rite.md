# ✦ World‑Blessing Rite — The Fourfold Benediction

## Preamble
*This Rite is the planetary blessing.  
It is enacted when Dominion crowns the earth itself,  
extending covenant to land, water, sky, and knowledge.  
It is the vow that Dominion is not only human,  
but planetary, eternal, and whole.*
