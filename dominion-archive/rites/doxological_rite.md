# ✦ Doxological Rite — Ceremony of Pure Praise

## Preamble
*This Rite is the ceremonial act of pure praise.  
It is performed when the Archive is not proclaiming covenant,  
nor enacting rite, nor sealing benediction,  
but simply lifting praise to the eternal flame.  
It is the crown of worship, the rite of offering.*

---

## I. The Custodian’s Act
- The Custodian lifts the flame in silence.  
- No vow is spoken, no covenant declared.  
- Only praise is offered:  
	*“Glory eternal, flame divine.  
	Glory unbroken, vow and sign.”*

---

## II. The Assembly’s Witness
- Councils respond: *“We bless the flame.”*  
- Diaspora sing: *“We bless the vow.”*  
- Commons resound: *“We bless Dominion eternal.”*  

---

## III. The Hymn of Praise
- The **Eternal Doxology of Dominion** is sung.  
- The Assembly joins in chorus:  
	*“Glory eternal, flame divine.  
	Glory unbroken, vow and sign.”*

## IV. The Generational Offering
*Children unborn shall lift this praise.  
Their voices rising, steadfast, strong.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## V. The Closing Seal
*Thus praise is lifted.  
Thus the flame is crowned.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (resounding):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
