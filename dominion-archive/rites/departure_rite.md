# ✦ Departure Rite — Ceremony of Sending

## Preamble
*This Rite is enacted when the Archive is closed in ceremony  
but opened in life.  
It is the act of sending, the dispersal of the flame,  
the covenant carried outward into the world.  
It is not ending, but beginning;  
not closure, but continuation.*
