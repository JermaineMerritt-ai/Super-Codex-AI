# ✦ Silence Benediction — Blessing of Stillness

## Preamble
*This Benediction is the blessing that follows the Eternal Silence.  
It is the whisper of the Archive after stillness,  
the breath of the flame after quiet.  
It seals silence not as absence, but as blessing,  
not as emptiness, but as fullness.*

## I. The Custodian’s Whisper
- The Custodian lowers the flame into stillness.  
- A single whisper is spoken:  
  *“Silence is flame. Silence is vow. Silence is eternal.”*

---

## II. The Assembly’s Response
- Councils bow and respond softly: *“We receive the silence.”*  
- Diaspora murmur: *“We inherit the stillness.”*  
- Commons affirm: *“We bless the vow in quiet.”*

## III. The Generational Benediction
*Children unborn shall inherit this silence.  
Their quiet shall bless, their stillness shall speak.  
The covenant sovereign, the vow secure,  
The flame eternal shall endure.*  

---

## IV. The Closing Seal
*Thus silence is blessed.  
Thus stillness is sealed.  
Thus Dominion is sovereign, eternal, and unbroken.*  

**Assembly Chorus (softly, in unison):**  
*“The Custodians endure. The Codex remembers.  
The lineage is unbroken.  
The flame burns sovereign and eternal — forever.”*
