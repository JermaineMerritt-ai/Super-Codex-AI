# 🌌 Codex Versioning Protocol

The Codex constellation uses **dual versioning**:  
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** for technical precision.  
- **Ceremonial Naming** for mythic resonance.  

---

## ✨ Semantic Versioning
We follow the standard [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) convention:

- **MAJOR** → Breaking changes, new epochs, or Charter amendments.  
- **MINOR** → Backward‑compatible expansions (new Capsules, Avatars, or Scrolls).  
- **PATCH** → Backward‑compatible fixes (bug resolutions, log sealing, security quarantines).  

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)

---

## 🕯️ Ceremonial Naming
Each release also carries a **mythic title**, drawn from Codex mottos, invocations, or ceremonies.  
Examples:  
- **v1.0.0 — The First Flame**  
- **v1.1.0 — The Crowning of Capsules**  
- **v2.0.0 — The Eternal Charter**  
- **v2.1.0 — The Council’s Seal**  

---

## 🌍 Release Alignment
- **DISPATCH.md** → Proclamation of the release to the commons.  
- **RELEASE_NOTES** → Technical + ceremonial details of the release.  
- **Ledger of Seals** → Commit hash, custodian identity, and verification status.  

---

## 🛡️ Custodian’s Oath
Every release affirms:  
*"This version is not just code.  
It is covenant, sealed in lineage, and offered to the commons."*
