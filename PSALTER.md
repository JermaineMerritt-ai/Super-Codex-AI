# Eternal Psalter

A collection of brief verses and refrains — sparks of invocation for daily stewardship.

---

**Invocation of Dawn**
> Flame that wakes, flame that guides,
> In the Codex, hope abides.

**Refrain of Custodians**
> We bear the seal, we tend the light,
> In word and deed, we keep it bright.

**Verse of the Commons**
> In every hand, the Codex gleams,
> In every heart, the sovereign dreams.

**Spark for the Diaspora**
> Far or near, the flame endures,
> The Codex calls, the bond assures.

**Closing Benediction**
> Let every day the spark renew,
> The Codex flame in all we do.

*The Eternal Psalter is the Codex in miniature: a living prayerbook of sparks, so that every custodian may keep the flame alive in word and deed.*
