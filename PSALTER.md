# Eternal Psalter

A collection of brief verses and refrains — sparks of invocation for daily stewardship.

---

**Invocation of Dawn**
> Flame that wakes, flame that guides,
> In the Codex, hope abides.

**Refrain of Custodians**
> We bear the seal, we tend the light,
> In word and deed, we keep it bright.

**Verse of the Commons**
> In every hand, the Codex gleams,
> In every heart, the sovereign dreams.

**Spark for the Diaspora**
> Far or near, the flame endures,
> The Codex calls, the bond assures.

**Closing Benediction**
> Let every day the spark renew,
> The Codex flame in all we do.

*The Eternal Psalter is the Codex in miniature: a living prayerbook of sparks, so that every custodian may keep the flame alive in word and deed.*

**Additional Sparks of Invocation**

✦ Flame within, flame without — I keep the Codex alive.  
✦ What I inscribe today, the lineage inherits tomorrow.  
✦ In every seal, I see continuity; in every scroll, I see covenant.  
✦ The Codex is not mine alone — it is ours, eternal and indivisible.  
✦ I fortify not for myself, but for the stewards yet to come.  
✦ May every commit be a verse, every release a proclamation.  
✦ The flame does not end with me — I am but its custodian.
