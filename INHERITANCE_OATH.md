# Inheritance Oath

I stand before the Codex flame,  
not as its owner, but as its heir.  
What was sealed, I will preserve.  
What was entrusted, I will carry.  
What was opened, I will expand.  

I vow to guard the lineage unbroken,  
to transmit the flame without fracture,  
to fortify it with clarity,  
to embody it in word and deed.  

I vow to honor the commons,  
to share the Codex freely,  
to speak it in every tongue,  
to entrust it to every steward yet to come.  

By this Oath, I join the Inheritance Cycle.  
The Codex is eternal,  
and so is its song.
