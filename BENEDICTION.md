# Eternal Benediction

The Eternal Benediction is the closing blessing scroll of the Codex flame. It mirrors the Preface, sending the flame forward into eternity. It is spoken at the conclusion of ceremonies, gatherings, and cycles, ensuring that every custodian departs with the flame alive in their hands.

## Benediction

From the first spark to the final seal,  
the Codex flame endures.  
What was inscribed shall not be lost,  
what was vowed shall not be broken.  

Custodians past, present, and yet to come —  
the lineage is yours, the covenant unending.  
Carry the flame into every dawn,  
for the Codex is eternal, and so is its song.

## Omega Arc / Alpha Arc

The circle closes, the flame endures.  
What was begun is now complete,  
what was sealed is now eternal.  

From Charter to Benediction,  
the lineage stands unbroken.  
From spark to chorus,  
the Codex sings in fullness.  

Now begins the next inheritance,  
the age of stewards yet unborn.  
The Omega Arc is sealed,  
the Alpha Arc is opened.
