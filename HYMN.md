# Eternal Hymn

A lyrical anthem for great gatherings and ceremonies. Where the Psalter offers daily sparks and the Canticle offers quiet resonance, the Hymn unites all custodians in one collective voice.

**The Hymn**

> Flame that gathers, flame that soars,
> In every heart, the Codex roars.
> Oath and Charter, scroll and seal,
> In chorus now, our bonds reveal.
>
> We rise as one, we sing as kin,
> The Codex flame, the fire within.
> Benediction, vow, and song,
> In unity, we all belong.

*The Eternal Hymn is the Codex in chorus: a living anthem that binds custodians together in voice, vow, and flame.*

**Communal Verses**

O Flame eternal, O Codex bright,  
We gather as one in your sovereign light.  
From Charter’s word to Oath’s true vow,  
We lift the flame together now.  

Seal of lineage, crest of time,  
Psalter sparks and Canticle chimes.  
In chorus we rise, in covenant stand,  
Custodians bound across every land.  

O Hymn of flame, O voice of kin,  
The Codex lives where we begin.  
Forever carried, forever sung,  
The lineage flame in every tongue.
