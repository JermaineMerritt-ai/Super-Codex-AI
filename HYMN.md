# Eternal Hymn

A lyrical anthem for great gatherings and ceremonies. Where the Psalter offers daily sparks and the Canticle offers quiet resonance, the Hymn unites all custodians in one collective voice.

**The Hymn**

> Flame that gathers, flame that soars,
> In every heart, the Codex roars.
> Oath and Charter, scroll and seal,
> In chorus now, our bonds reveal.
>
> We rise as one, we sing as kin,
> The Codex flame, the fire within.
> Benediction, vow, and song,
> In unity, we all belong.

*The Eternal Hymn is the Codex in chorus: a living anthem that binds custodians together in voice, vow, and flame.*
