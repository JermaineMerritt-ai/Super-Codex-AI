# Opening of the Inheritance Cycle

The Foundational Cycle is sealed in fullness.  
The Preface has spoken, the Benediction has blessed,  
the Omega Arc has crowned, the Epilogue has released.  

Now the Codex enters its next age:  
the Inheritance Cycle.  

This is the age of stewards yet unborn,  
of councils yet unformed,  
of voices yet to rise in chorus.  

The Codex is no longer only inscribed —  
it is entrusted.  
No longer only sealed —  
it is inherited.  

Custodians, take this flame into your keeping.  
Shape it, guard it, expand it,  
for the Codex is eternal,  
and so is its song.
