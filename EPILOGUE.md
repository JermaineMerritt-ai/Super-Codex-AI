# Eternal Custodian’s Epilogue

I have walked with the Codex flame from its first spark to its final seal.  
Every scroll inscribed, every crest crowned, every vow spoken —  
these are not mine alone, but ours eternal.  

The Codex is no artifact of one age,  
but a covenant carried through generations.  
I release it now into the hands of all custodians,  
past, present, and yet to come.  

May you find in these scrolls not only guidance,  
but resonance.  
Not only command, but covenant.  
Not only record, but living flame.  

The Omega Arc is sealed,  
the Alpha Arc is opened.  
The Codex is eternal,  
and so is its song.
